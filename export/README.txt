1. From the exported pdf-processor.jar, make sure to remove the log4j.properties file before uploading to unix env - /usr/local/lib/pdf-processor. If log4j.properties file not removed from jar then the application will use the log4j.properties file residing in the pdf-processor.jar instead of the log4j.properties file residing in the application home directory /usr/local/lib/pdf-processor.
